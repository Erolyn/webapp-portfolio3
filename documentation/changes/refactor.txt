Frontend:
- Zod validation. 
- Attempt at making components better, mainly focused on project-components. Components are now split into features: Initially experiences and projects. As projects was a little more time-consuming than expected, "remaining" components were put into "intro".
- Cleaned up App.tsx and split into pages - Unfortunately SPA-functionality from the previous portfolio was difficult to implement, tried solving this with PageContext, but this is not functional. 

Backend:
- Projects has been expanded with new fields: is_publishes and project_date. 
- SQLite db integration. Attempted prisma, but proved difficult.
- Zod validates project-data. 
- APIs and responses have been refactored. 
- CRUD functionality implemented. 
- Layered backend - controller, mapper, repo and service-layers.
